# Harry's Restaurant
Harry's Restaurant is a full-stack, responsive website built for a fictional Restaurant for educational purposes only.

It allows the user to create an account so they can make a booking at table at the restaurant. Users can also browse the menu, letting them veiw the delicious dishes that are on offer.

## Agile Methodology
The plan for this project was carried out using Agile Methodology. GitHub Issues were used to record the User Stories. These were made up of all the key functionality that a user would expect from a Restaurant website.

Each Each User Story contains Acceptance Criteria and Tasks which I sometimes had to adjust during the process, as I wasn't yet sure what was required to achieve the Acceptance Criteria.

To aid with prioritisation, I used The MoSCoW Method, which consisted of classifying each User Story as a 'Must Have', 'Should Have' or 'Could Have'. Some 'Could Have's didn't make it into the project and were left in the Backlog for a future iteration. It is important to note here, that by writing only enough User Stories to reach the Minimum Viable Product(MVP), 'Won't Have' was not included currently as a category.

To summarise, I found using the Agile Methodology of great benefit as it helped me to better organise, prioritise and plan the development of my project. Although I didn't give myself a specific duration for each iteration, it greatly helped my time management. I also felt sense of achievement, ticking off the Tasks while working on a User Story and placing it in the 'Done' column when it was completed.

### Structure / Designs Choices

The website is simple to use and consistent within its structure. The website was designed to be responsive on screens from 375px and above, making it great ti use from mobile to desktop.

For desktop users the navigation bar shows the 'Harry's Restaurant' logo and links to pages for 'Home', 'Bookings', 'Menu' and 'Logout' (for authenticated users) or 'Sign up' and 'Login' pages (for unauthenticated users). For users on a screen size of 767px or below the navigation bar will collapse down and be accessible via a burger button to save screen space and a more polished appearance. The navigation bar is repeated across all pages on the site, allowing for easy navigation.

The Footer displays social media links which open in a separate tab for ease of use. It also displays the restaurants's address, the opening hours and other contact details. The footer is also repeated across all pages to keep the design uniform and for ease of access.

The Home Page clearly indicates the purpose of the site with a jumbotron which will urge users to sign up (for unauthenticated users) or book a table (for authenticated users). Below is a description of the restaurant which describes the style of cuisine on offer and an 'Our Story' section, which gives insight to the orgins of the restaurant and its mission.

The Bookings page allow users to easily see all of there bookings that have been made and clearly display the details of the booking. Users can also edit and cancel any of their bookings as well as add a new booking from this page. Users can also click the booking number of any booking to see the details of that particular booking.

The Menu page clearly shows the user what food the restaurant has on offer. the dishes are broken down in categories of Starters, Mains and Deserts.

The Sign up / Login pages are clear and and display the fields in a familiar format to the user.
