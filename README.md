# Harry's Restaurant
Harry's Restaurant is a full-stack, responsive website built for a fictional Restaurant for educational purposes only.

It allows the user to create an account so they can make a booking at table at the restaurant. Users can also browse the menu, letting them veiw the delicious dishes that are on offer.

## Agile Methodology
The plan for this project was carried out using Agile Methodology. GitHub Issues were used to record the User Stories. These were made up of all the key functionality that a user would expect from a Restaurant website.

Each Each User Story contains Acceptance Criteria and Tasks which I sometimes had to adjust during the process, as I wasn't yet sure what was required to achieve the Acceptance Criteria.

To aid with prioritisation, I used The MoSCoW Method, which consisted of classifying each User Story as a 'Must Have', 'Should Have' or 'Could Have'. Some 'Could Have's didn't make it into the project and were left in the Backlog for a future iteration. It is important to note here, that by writing only enough User Stories to reach the Minimum Viable Product(MVP), 'Won't Have' was not included currently as a category.

To summarise, I found using the Agile Methodology of great benefit as it helped me to better organise, prioritise and plan the development of my project. Although I didn't give myself a specific duration for each iteration, it greatly helped my time management. I also felt sense of achievement, ticking off the Tasks while working on a User Story and placing it in the 'Done' column when it was completed.
